NAME
    Acme::CPAN::Testers::FalseNegative - Pretending to be
    Acme::CPAN::Testers::FAIL

VERSION
    version 0.02

DESCRIPTION
    This module is being used as an experiment to see what happens when an
    identical distribution name and version is uploaded to CPAN.

    There is already:

        BINGOS/Acme-CPAN-Testers-FAIL-0.02.tar.gz

    This will have the same name and version and different module (that will
    still be indexed).

    We'll see how search engines and RT can cope.
